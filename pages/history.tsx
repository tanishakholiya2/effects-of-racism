            <h1> History of Racism </h1>
            <p>  Racism dates back to the south atlantic system when millions of African Americans were uprooted 
                and forced to come to America through the Middle Passage. White men enslaved many African Americans that worked on 
                plantations in order to farm cash crops and other crops. Slavery was heavily relied on in the colonies, especially
                the Southern colonies, and enslaved people faced harsh conditions and violence. Racism became embedded in laws, through laws 
                that prohibited sexual intercourse between whites and Africans. With the end of the American revolution, the Northern colonies started to abolish
                 slavery due to new revolutionary ideas, but the Southern colonies increased their use of slavery because of the cotton revolution. The contrast 
                 of the dependence of labor from enslaved people in the South and the gradual abolition of slavery in the North led to deepened conflicts due to 
                 compromises made over slavery. These conflicts led to the civil war as the South seceded from the Union because they believed that their constitutional rights were being 
                 threatened as slavery was not being protected. The end of the civil war led to the start of Reconstruction, where slavery was finally abolished and African Americans gained the right to vote. 
                 However, African Americans still faced violence through the Ku Klux Klan and reconstruction quickly came to an end with the election of Hayes and African Americans still faced violence. After the end of reconstruction, 
                 African Americans continued to face racism. Many African Americans were charged with “vagrancy”, the offense of not being able to prove that you were employed, and arrested. After getting arrested, African Americans were sold to big companies 
                 and they were forced to work long hours in dangerous mines and were subjected to violence and diseases. Additionally, Natives faced lots of hardships as they continuously had land taken away from them since White Protestant believed in “Manifest Destiny”, 
                 the belief that white Americans were chosen by god to settle all of North America. Natives were forced to relocate and many of their tribes were split apart. After reconstruction, white Americans forced assimilation on many Natives by forcing their kids to
                  go to boarding schools that taught them about white culture. Many immigrants faced hardships after moving to America. Americans felt threatened by Chinese immigrants who were willing to work for low wages, leading to the Chinese Exclusion Act that prohibited immigration of Chinese. </p>
