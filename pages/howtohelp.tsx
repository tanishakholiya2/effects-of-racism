            <p> There are many ways that you can help to fight racism in your community. Educate yourself on the
                 injustices that people of color face in their everyday lives. Listen to the stories of people of
                  color and support them. Educate yourself by watching podcasts, reading articles, or watching documentaries
                   on racism and discrimination. Examine your own biases. Many people have absorbed biases throughout their
                    lives, because of their environment and recognizing your own biases is an active step to fighting against 
                    the system. Stand up for colored people when they are facing injustices. Do not be a bystander, but rather 
                    challenge racism and discrimination, even when it is in the form of a joke. Educate others on the harmful nature of racist jokes and comments. 
                    Join or start an organization in your community that is focused on fighting racism, such as a protest group, an advocacy group, or a community organization. 
                    Put pressure on local and state legislatures to pass laws that protect people of color. Speak up when you witness racism or discriminatory acts. 
                    You can make a difference in your community and help to fight racism.</p>
